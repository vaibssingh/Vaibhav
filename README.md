## Hello! Welcome to my page

I am creating it just to keep track of my progress as I learn. Also, because now I can say that I have my own website ðŸ˜Ž

You can see my all other completed/under-progress work [here](https://github.com/vaibssingh). I am mostly interested in Machine Learning and anything related to Linux (and TV shows and movies as well!). 

### Some more stuff about me

I try to dabble in machine learning and data science in general. Some implementations of these can be found on my Github profile. I also know a fair bit about Linux based OS specially Ubuntu. Some other things I know:

- Python
- Basics of JavaScript
- How to make instant noodles
