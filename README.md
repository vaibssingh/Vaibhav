## Hello! Welcome to my page

I am creating it to keep track of my progress as I learn. Also, because now I can say that I have my own website ðŸ˜Ž

You can see my all completed/under-progress work [here](https://github.com/vaibssingh). I am mostly interested in Machine Learning and related fields. 

Some of my projects can be found on my Github profile. Few things that I can claim to know:

- Python
- Node.js
- How to make instant noodles

### Some more stuff about me

I am also a huge movies and TV shows fan. It's too late in the night to remember anything else. //TODO: Put more interesting stuff to make it more interestingly interesting.
### Contact

You can reach me at [email](mailto:singhvaibhav592@gmail.com) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gallifreyanboi). See ya!
